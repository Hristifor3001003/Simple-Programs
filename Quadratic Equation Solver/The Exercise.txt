The exercise:

Create a windows forms application presented with a single form and visual appearance as in the picture Picture.png.

The application should have the following functionalities:

	1. The application should enable the solutions of a general quadratic equation of the type ax^2 + bc + c = 0, where a, b, c are numbers from the interval [-1000000, 1000000]
	   and the can be both integers or decimal numbers, and also a must be non-zero.

	2. The coeffcients a, b, c are entered in the corresponding input fields, where the coefficient a is entered in the first input field i.e the field before X^2, the coefficient
	   b is entered in the second field i.e the field before X, and the third coefficient is entered in the last third field.
	   
	3. The soultions can be real numbers, or complex numbers, and the application should enable the both.
