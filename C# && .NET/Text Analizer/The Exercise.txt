
Create an windows forms application "Text Analizer". Ð¢he graphical user interface should looks like the one shown in 
the picture "Picture.jpeg". The user enters text into the text input field in the left half 
of the application. It can be entered in multiple lines and consists of multiple words and sentences. Sentences are made 
up of multiple words. Words are separated from each other by spaces. There can be words made up of one letter each (eg the word "a"). After pressing
the process button, the application should analyze the entered text and calculate  the number (frequency) of occurence of each of the words in the text.
The application is not case-sensitive  i.e it treats the words "Word" and "word" the same). Then in the field in the right half of the application, he writes 
uniquely found words (words that appears more than once, he writed them only once), and to the right os them, in the same row, the application writes a natural number 
that shows the number of occurences of corresponding word in the text. Each found word is written in a separate line.
